## Purpose of this game
Our hack is a game where players have to match different items to their respective recycling bins with increasing difficulty over time. We believe that in order to encourage more individuals to recycle, the first step should be education. Our hack is targeted at young children and seeks to teach them about the 4 main recycling groups, namely - paper, metal, glass and plastic as well as items that are not recyclable. By introducing the concepts of recycling to young children in a fun and hands-on manner from a young age, we hope that it will educate them on the importance of recycling and thus make recycling a part of their routine as they grow up.

## How to play?
The aim of the game is to put the right item in the right recycling bin! They are divided into 5 colours - Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Grey with labels as well. Simply drag the item to the appropriate bin and you will score a point. However, you only have 3 lives - If you fail to put the item in the right bin, your lives will be deducted! If you get 40 points you win the bragging rights to say you know all about recycling!
